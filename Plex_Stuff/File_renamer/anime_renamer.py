def rename_tv_show_files(show_name, year=None):
    """
    Renames TV show files in the current directory to follow Plex's naming convention.
    It first displays a preview of the changes before renaming the files.

    Plex Naming Format:
        Show Name (Year) - sXXXXeYYYY [edition-Language].ext

    Supported Naming Formats (examples):
        • "[AH] Dr. Stone S2 - 01 (1080p).mkv"
            → Dr. Stone [edition-Subbed] - s0002e0001.mp4
        • "[SubsPlease] Dr. Stone S4 - 03 (1080p) [691F8C8D].mkv"
            → Dr. Stone [edition-Subbed] - s0004e0003.mp4
        • "Dr Stone Season 2 Stone Wars Episode 9 English Dubbed ..."
            → Dr Stone [edition-Dubbed] - s0002e0009.mp4
        • "Dr Stone Season 3 New World Episode 9 English Dubbed ..."
            → Dr Stone [edition-Dubbed] - s0003e0009.mp4
        • "Akagami no Shirayuki-hime Season 2 Episode 2 English Subbed ..."
            → Snow White with the Red Hair [edition-Subbed] - s0002e0002.mp4

    Language Detection:
        - If the filename contains "subbed" (case-insensitive), it is marked as Subbed.
        - Otherwise, if it contains "dubbed" or "dub", it is marked as Dubbed.
        - If neither is found, it defaults to Subbed.

    Args:
        show_name (str): The name of the TV show.
        year (str, optional): The release year (optional).
